# Database_for_finance_division_using_postgreSQL

This repository contains Python scripts that are used and aim to assist the Finance department in processing and organizing financial division data. The object of this script is to create a PostgreSQL server-based database, where the database contents come from a database in CSV format. Therefore, the financial division database, which was previously managed and organized using Microsoft Excel, was converted into a database with a PostgreSQL server.
